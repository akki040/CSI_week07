##  Project Overview

This Streamlit web application uses a trained machine learning model to predict passenger survival based on the following inputs:

- Sex (Male/Female)
- Age (Slider)
- Fare Paid
- Passenger Class (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
- Port of Embarkation (Southampton, Cherbourg, Queenstown)

The app uses a Random Forest Classifier trained on the Titanic dataset to make predictions and show the probability of survival.
